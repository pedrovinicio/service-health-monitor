# Service health monitoring app

Keep up to date on your services's health. Add a service to see if it is UP or DOWN. A service that is UP is represented by a GREEN box while a DOWN service is represented by a RED box. You can later remove or edit the added service.

## How to configure

Running the following command will configure the application with the necessary dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## How to run locally

The application can be run locally with the following command:

```
npm start
```

## Tests

The application can be tested using the following command:

```
npm test
```

This will run all tests in the `src` folder and it will watch for any changes to either tests or the imports of the tests to determine if the test should be re-run.

## Requirements

- Node 16+
- npm 8+

## TODO

- Improve testing
- Add animations
- Localization
